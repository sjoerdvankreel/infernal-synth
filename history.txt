February 10, 2024 - V1.4.

* No changes.

August 27, 2023 - V1.4 preview.

* Notes:

- Probably needs a plugin rescan because the folder structure changed (again).

* New stuff:

- Made a Cakewalk demo.
- Added CLAP support. Feature parity with VST3, but, no polyphonic modulation yet.

* Breaking changes:

- Dropped support for the "generic" version. 
-- 1.4 replaces 1.3-versioned.
-- "Generic" build will no longer be updated.
-- 1.4 can still run side by side with 1.3-generic.
-- From now on versioned/generic distinction will be gone.

- Changed the preset file format.
-- Load/save works with .ispreset files. Ispreset files can be shared between vst3/clap.
-- .Vstpreset files are still supported but you have to use the host wrapper interface.

August 27, 2023 - V1.3.

* No changes.

August 12, 2023 - V1.3 preview.

Implemented some feedback from KVR OSC #174.

V1.3 should be backwards compatible with V1.2, but NOT with v1.2-Instrument only.
Renoise users: parameter order changed and this will break automation.
See https://forum.renoise.com/t/saved-automation-data-does-not-respect-vst3s-parameter-id/68461/2.

* New stuff:

- Free-running random lfos.
- Right-click knob allows exact-edit.
- UI Size/Theme/Last directory are now shared across plugin instances.

- New oscillator param: pitch bend semitones.
- New modulation target: oscillator pitch.
- New modulation sources: midi mod wheel, channel volume, channel pressure, pitch wheel.
Default "clear" and "init" patches now set up midi PB and midi CP to sensible defaults.

* Fixes:
- Host no longer steals keyboard focus from load/save dialog.
- Split fx/instrument to different binaries as some hosts have problems with both in 1 dll.

* Changes:
- Oscillator cents changed from +/-50 to +/- 100.
- Renamed dialog/filebox in theme (only interesting for custom themes).
- Filtered N/A targets from modulation targets (i.e. fx1 filter freq is disabled when fx1 is a wave shaper.)

July 29, 2023 - V1.2.

* No changes.

July 22, 2023 - V1.2-preview4.

* Fix slow UI repainting.

July 19, 2023 - V1.2-preview3.

* Flipped ui offset/scale parameters.

July 11, 2023 - V1.2-preview2.

* More 3d themes.
* New flat themes.
* Bugfix related to exact editing.

July 5, 2023 - V1.2-preview1.

* Complete UI rewrite.
- Bigger knobs.
- Voice and global section on separate tabs.
- Improved theming support, theme files only consist of colors and images.
- Resizing UI support (not completely free, selection of predefined sizes).
- No exact-editing next to each knob, single place to exact-edit last tweaked param.
- Dropped the infernal images by default, they are still there in the "infernal" theme.
- More logical layout, moved voice-related parameters from master to voice input section.
- Less dependent on context menu. Init / clear / load / save / load factory patch now accessible without context menu.

* Breaking changes:
- Dropped oscillator gain.
- Changed the behaviour of ring and amp mod parameters.
- Decreased the number of routes in both the voice and global cv and audio routing matrices, to make for a cleaner ui.

* New features:
- Added hold stage for multitap and feedback delay.

April 5, 2023 - V1.1.3.

* Small host-specific fixes.
* Cltrl+left-click opens context menu.
* Ctrl+alt+shift+m opens context menu.
* Merge instrument and fx plugin into 1 binary.
* Load/save preset from within the plugin itself (don't rely on the host). 

March 15, 2023 - V1.1.2.

* Rewrite uidesc and rename background images to allow a bit of theming.
* Clear-patch now sets the plugin to the very minimum configuration that actually produces sound.

March 12, 2023 - V1.1.1.

* Switched AVX2 to AVX1.
* Force linear knob mode.
* Bugfix: 0 BPM would crash the plugin.

March 6, 2023 - V1.1.

* Updated UI.
* Trimmed down output tab.
* Improved default/initial patches.
* Global audio bank 1 can no longer be disabled.
* Increased envelope section length to 20 seconds.
* Provide versioned builds to insulate from breaking changes.
* Renamed project from SevenSynth to InfernalSynth because of name clashes.

* New features:
- Added oscillator gain parameter.
- Provide 3 unipolar and 3 bipolar master CV controls.
- MIDI in as modulation source (aka "generic keyboard tracking").
- Both feedback and multitap delay now have stereo spread controls.

* Breaking changes:
- Removed CV bank base parameter.
- Removed triplets from tempo-synced parameters.
- Decreased number of routes in CV A and Audio B.
- Most delay (both feedback and multitap) parameters changed.
- Master CV parameters changed (uni/bipolar switch replaced by actual bipolar controls).

January 25, 2023 - V1.0.
* Initial release.
